The Stanford C++ Libraries (Whittier version)
=============================================

The Stanford C++ libraries were originally developed by Stanford Professor Eric Roberts, 
with the assistance of Julie Zelenski, Keith Schwarz, and other members of Stanford's
Computer Science department.

This is an unofficial modified version of the Stanford C++ libraries 
that is currently being used in Whittier College's COSC 220 (Computer Science II) course. 
This version is maintained by Jeff Lutgen; it contains numerous minor bugfixes and 
customizations to the official version, and incorporates many of Stanford Lecturer Marty 
Stepp's modifications to the official libraries.
