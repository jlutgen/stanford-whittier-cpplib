1. Changed Makefile: target=1.6, source=1.6
because compiling with Java 1.7 creates spl.jar that doesn't work
on Win7.

2. Changed acknowledgeEvent in JavaBackEnd.java to send
"result=___jbe___ack___" instead of "result:ack", assuming the former
is less likely to occur as an actual console input from user. The string
"___jbe___ack___" is caught by getResult() in platform.cpp.

3. Added code for console menu (cut, copy, paste, select all) in 
JBEConsole and JavaBackEnd.
